### Databases
- [IMGTHLA](https://github.com/ANHIG/IMGTHLA) - Github for files currently published in the IPD-IMGT/HLA FTP Directory hosted at the European Bioinformatics Institute.
- [IPD-IMGT/HLA Database](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ipd/imgt/hla/) - The IPD-IMGT/HLA Database provides a specialist database for sequences of the human major histocompatibility complex (MHC) and includes the official sequences named by the WHO Nomenclature Committee For Factors of the HLA System.
- [Allele Frequency Database](http://www.allelefrequencies.net/) - A public resource that collects information on allele, genotype and haplotype frequencies from different polymorphic areas in the human genome such as human leukocyte antigens (HLA), killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptors, etc.

### Information
- [HLA Nomenclature](https://hla.alleles.org/nomenclature/index.html) - Nomenclature of HLA Alleles

### Python Libraries
- [NMDP - py-ard](https://github.com/nmdp-bioinformatics/py-ard) - HLA Antigen Recognition Domain (ARD) Reduction in Python (Swiss army knife of HLA Nomenclature). Py-ard an reduce typings from NMDP multiple allele code (MAC) designations, XX codes, as well as serologic nomenclature.

### Tools
